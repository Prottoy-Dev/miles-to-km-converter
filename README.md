# miles-to-km-converter
This code is a Python program that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the tkinter library. The purpose of the application is to convert distances from miles to kilometers. Here's a brief description of the code:

The code begins with a comment block explaining its purpose, usage, author, and date.

It imports the tkinter library, which provides the necessary tools for creating the GUI.

The calculate function is defined. This function is called when the "Calculate" button is pressed and performs the conversion from miles to kilometers. It takes the user-entered value in miles, converts it to kilometers, and displays the result in a Label widget on the GUI.

The main application window is created using Tk(), and its title is set to "Mile to Km Converter."

The window's padding (padding in the x and y directions) is configured to provide some spacing around the widgets.

An Entry widget is created, allowing the user to input the distance in miles. This widget is placed in the grid layout of the window.

Labels are created to display the text "Miles," "is equals to," and "Km." These labels provide context to the user for the input and output fields.

A "Calculate" Button is created, which, when clicked, triggers the calculate function to perform the conversion.

Finally, the tkinter event loop (window.mainloop()) is started to display the GUI and allow the user to interact with it.

In summary, this code creates a simple GUI application for converting miles to kilometers, with a user-friendly interface that includes input fields, labels, and a button for performing the conversion.
